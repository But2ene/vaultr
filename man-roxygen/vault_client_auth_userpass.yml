custom_mount:
  short: >-
    Set up a \code{vault_client_auth_userpass} object at a custom mount.
    For example, suppose you mounted the \code{userpass} authentication
    backend at \code{/userpass2} you might use \code{up <-
    vault$auth$userpass2$custom_mount("/userpass2")} - this pattern
    is repeated for other secret and authentication backends.
  params:
    mount: String, indicating the path that the engine is mounted at.

write:
  short: >-
    Create or update a user.
  params:
    username: Username for the user
    password: Password for the user (required when creating a user only)
    policy: Character vector of policies for the user
    ttl: The lease duration which decides login expiration
    max_ttl: Maximum duration after which login should expire
    bound_cidrs: >-
      Character vector of CIDRs.  If set, restricts usage of the login
      and token to client IPs falling within the range of the
      specified CIDR(s).

read:
  short: >-
    Reads the properties of an existing username.
  params:
    username: Username to read

delete:
  short: Delete a user
  params:
    username: Username to delete

update_password:
  short: Update password for a user
  params:
    username: Username for the user to update
    password: New password for the user

update_policies:
  short: Update vault policies for a user
  params:

    policy: Character vector of policies for this user

list:
  short: List users known to vault

login:
  short: >-
    Log into the vault using username/password authentication.
    Normally you would not call this directly but instead use
    \code{$login} with \code{method = "userpass"} and proving the
    \code{username} argument and optionally the \code{password}
    argument.  This function returns a vault token but does not set it
    as the client token.
  params:
    username: Username to authenticate with
    password: >-
      Password to authenticate with. If omitted or \code{NULL} and the
      session is interactive, the password will be prompted for.
