\title{Make a vault client}
\usage{
vault_client(login = FALSE, ..., addr = NULL, tls_config = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{login}{Login method.  Specify a string to be passed along as
the \code{method} argument to \code{$login}.  The default
\code{FALSE} means not to login.  \code{TRUE} means to login
using a default method specified by the environment variable
\code{VAULTR_AUTH_METHOD} - if that variable is not set, an
error is thrown.  The value of \code{NULL} is the same as
\code{TRUE} but does not throw an error if
\code{VAULTR_AUTH_METHOD} is not set.  Supported methods are
\code{token}, \code{github} and \code{userpass}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed along to the authentication
method indicated by \code{login}, if used.}

\item{addr}{The value address \emph{including protocol and port},
e.g., \code{https://vault.example.com:8200}.  If not given, the
default is the environment variable \code{VAULT_ADDR}, which is
the same as used by vault's command line client.}

\item{tls_config}{TLS (https) configuration.  For most uses this
can be left blank.  However, if your vault server uses a
self-signed certificate you will need to provide this.  Defaults
to the environment variable \code{VAULT_CAPATH}, which is the
same as vault's command line client.}
}
\description{
Make a vault client.  This must be done before accessing the
vault.  The deafults for arguments are controlled by environment
variables (see Details) and values provided as arguments override
these defaults.

\section{Methods}{

\cr\describe{
\item{\code{api}}{
  Returns an api client object that can be used to directly interact with the vault server.
  \cr\emph{Usage:}\code{api()}
}
\item{\code{read}}{
  Read a value from the vault.  This can be used to read any value that you have permission to read, and can also be used as an interface to a version 1 key-value store (see \code{\link{vault_client_kv1}}.  Similar to the vault CLI command \code{vault read}.
  \cr\emph{Usage:}\code{read(path, field = NULL, metadata = FALSE)}
  \cr\emph{Arguments:}
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{path}:   Path for the secret to read, such as \code{/secret/mysecret}
    }

    \item{\code{field}:   Optional field to read from the secret.  Each secret is stored as a key/value set (represented in R as a named list) and this is equivalent to using \code{[[field]]} on the return value. The default, \code{NULL}, returns the full set of values.
    }

    \item{\code{metadata}:   Logical, indicating if we should return metadata for this secret (lease information etc) as an attribute along with hte values itself.  Ignored if \code{field} is specified.
    }
  }
}
\item{\code{write}}{
  Write data into the vault.  This can be used to write any value that you have permission to write, and can also be used as an interface to a version 1 key-value store (see \code{\link{vaule_client_kv1}}.  Similar to the vault CLI command \code{vault write}.
  \cr\emph{Usage:}\code{write(path, data)}
  \cr\emph{Arguments:}
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{path}:   Path for the secret to write, such as \code{/secret/mysecret}
    }

    \item{\code{data}:   A named list of values to write into the vault at this path. This \emph{replaces} any existing values.
    }
  }
}
\item{\code{list}}{
  List data in the vault at a give path.  This can be used to list keys, etc (e.g., at \code{/secret}).
  \cr\emph{Usage:}\code{list(path, full_names = FALSE)}
  \cr\emph{Arguments:}
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{path}:   The path to list
    }

    \item{\code{full_names}:   Logical, indicating if full paths (relative to the vault root) should be returned.
    }
  }
  \cr\emph{Value}:
  A character vector (of zero length if no keys are found).  Paths that are "directories" (i.e., that contain keys and could themselves be listed) will be returned with a trailing forward slash, e.g. \code{path/}
}
\item{\code{login}}{
  Login to the vault.  This method is more complicated than most.
  \cr\emph{Usage:}\code{login(..., method = "token", mount = NULL, renew = FALSE,
      quiet = FALSE, token_only = FALSE, use_cache = TRUE)}
  \cr\emph{Arguments:}
  \itemize{

  }
}
\item{\code{status}}{
  Return the status of the vault server, including whether it is sealed or not, and the valut server version.
  \cr\emph{Usage:}\code{status()}
}
}
}
